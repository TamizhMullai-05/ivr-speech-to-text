**Project Title :**
Building a Speech-to-Text System with
Integrated Language Modeling for Improved
Accuracy in Transcription Services
**Description**
# ivr-speech-to-text
A noise-robust speech-to-text transcription system designed for IVR (Interactive Voice Response) applications using Wav2Vec2. This project simulates noisy customer service environments, processes audio with background interference, and evaluates transcription accuracy using word error rate (WER).
**ðŸ”‘ Key Features**

âœ… Noise-Robust Transcription: Simulates noisy call center environments using real-world background audio.

âœ… Preprocessing Pipeline: Adds configurable background noise at various SNR levels to clean IVR prompts.

âœ… Speech-to-Text Inference: Uses pretrained Wav2Vec2 models from HuggingFace for accurate transcription.

âœ… Evaluation with WER: Measures transcription quality using Word Error Rate (WER) via the jiwer library.

âœ… Domain-Specific Focus: Designed for IVR use cases like customer service automation and call routing.

âœ… Visualization Support: Includes waveform and spectrogram plots to explore audio characteristics.

âœ… Modular Code: Separated scripts for preprocessing, inference, evaluation, and EDA.
